            <br></br>

            <p className='text-gray-300 text-lg'>I left my 8 year career in the training field to pursue my passion for programming. After several years of self teaching, I attended a university and earned my degree in Software Engineering. I created this website to showcase some of the projects I have worked on. I am excited to continue growing my skills and expanding my knowledge!</p>

            <br></br>

            <p className='text-gray-300 text-lg'>Here is a little personal information about me. I grew up and live in the Pacific Northwest with my wife and daughter. I enjoy running, biking, reading, and gaming. I have a growing playing card collection. My biggest passion is learning. I spend months delving into topics that have piqued my interest.</p>

            <br></br>

            <p className='text-gray-300 text-lg'>Send me an email if you would like to explore working on a project together!</p>
